# BookletMaker
This is a fully static website that will do pdf saddle-stitch imposition to allow you to print your notes as booklets easily.

And the best part, it is for **FREE!**

I don't get why every app out there feels the need to monetize this, but fear no more, the website is easy to use and includes instruction.

For any issues feel free to email me :)
